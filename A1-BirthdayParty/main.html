                    <h2>My birthday is on September 4th, 2003.</h2>
                    <p>During the week of August 30th to September 6th 2003, this song was <b>#1 on the Billboard Top 100!</b></p>
                    <h2>Some fun facts about this release:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some of the songs themes, particularly surrounding anxiety, were directly inspired by will.i.am's experience during the September 11th attacks in 2001.</li>
                        <li>The release of the album that contained this song, <i>Elephunk,</i> marked the group's first forray into pop music.
                            This move came after a period of high tension and mixed success on their previous albums.
                            The shift turned out to be highly successful one, ranking them #1 on the Billboard Top 100 for several weeks in a row,
                            from August 23rd to September 27th 2003.</li>
                        <li>The song includes many references to international issues of the era, but focuses largely on both domestic and global terrorism.
                            One of the lyrics of the song comparing the CIA to terrorists was later removed.</li>
                        <li>The song's BPM is 94, intended to mimic the human heartbeat.
                            This was chosen as the BPM because the song was meant as a sort of "check-up" on the pulse of the world and the direction it was headed.</li>
                        <li>As of 2011, <i>Where is the Love?</i> had sold 3.2 million copies worldwide.</li>
                    </ul>
